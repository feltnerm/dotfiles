dotfiles
========

Just my dotfiles

To symlink all files in this directory to your ~/
>ruby bin/deploy.rb 

Minimum requirements:
* zsh

You'll be able to fully experience The Awesome if you find yourself using any combination of the following:
_these are not requirements, but suggestions_
* arch linux
* awesome window manager
* vim || gvim (for included plugins see vimrc)
* virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper
* git
* screen


And some goodies:
* xinitrc
  * xset - set keyboard/mouse settings
  * numlockx - enable numlock
  * xflux - set the color temperature of the monitor based on geographic location and time of day
  * nitrogen - set/save/restore wallpaper
  * pulseaudio
  * xscreensaver
  * xcompmgr
  * rxvt-unicode
* ncmpcpp
* cmus

bin/ has more requirements, but I think most of them are obvious on inspection.
